                                        In spite of the high stakes faced by humanity in the 21st 
                                        century, life went on peacefully. Technological 
                                        progress continued to reach heights never before imagined. 
                                        This gave an incredible comfort of life to the humans of 
                                        the planet Earth. This progress was made possible by the 
                                        takeover of nations and large religious groups by huge digital 
                                        and tech giants. By a tacit economic agreement, they agreed 
                                        to destroy all identity and cultural differences between their 
                                        people, in order to create a huge global market where everyone 
                                        is "equal" and can trade freely with each other. Wealth gaps 
                                        widened dramatically during this period.

                                        The rise of the medical tech field greatly extended and 
                                        improved the lives of human beings.
                                        Diseases were eradicated, as well as handicaps, hereditary 
                                        diseases, less attractive morphologies, etc. Cloning technologies 
                                        had a relatively positive impact on the planet at first. 
                                        The eugenism that followed was also acclaimed in the name of 
                                        holy progress. The economic elites were able to reach a 
                                        level of genetic perfection never known before. Inspired by 
                                        the Greek gods, they modified their genetics to improve not 
                                        only their health and appearance, but also their intellectual 
                                        capacity. The poorest of the poor became a population that, 
                                        although in the vast majority on the surface of the globe, 
                                        was treated as an error of nature, an unattractive, dirty, 
                                        and imperfect being. This paradigm shift had two consequences 
                                        among this population, a part of them, out of nihilism and 
                                        adoration of the elites and their way of life, formed a cult 
                                        of the elite, a cult of their beauty, their wealth and their
                                        genetic perfection. They called themselves the Transhumanomicus.

                                        The other part, growing every day in the face of these 
                                        injustices, called the "dissidents" or "conspiracists" by the 
                                        elites, refused en bloc this unequal and superficial world 
                                        founded around the mirage of the cult of money and materialism. 
                                        They lived in seclusion outside the big cities but were 
                                        often arrested by the government for the crime of "non-conformity" 
                                        and were enrolled in re-education centers, also 
                                        called "consumer factories".

                                        In the year 2051, when the last drop of oil was extracted, came 
                                        3 years of energy blackout and violence.
                                        The proletarian class was massively hit by unemployment, and 
                                        even the elites suffered, having lost the monetary contribution 
                                        of their consumer armies, an unprecedented world economic crisis ensued.
                                        Tensions erupted in all earthly communities and this was 
                                        the first massive use of drones to monitor and control the population.
                                        Indeed, the philanthropist Bruce Rahman was able, thanks 
                                        to his factories in Itaipu (located on the border of the 
                                        former Brazil and Paraguay) to build an army of solar-powered 
                                        surveillance drones.
                                        His drones allowed him to keep a relative control on his 
                                        population, as well as to double his fortune by selling them 
                                        to other state companies.
                                        These drones were positioned during the day at key 
                                        points, in order to recharge their batteries, and then 
                                        patrolled at night, armed with large projectors.
                                        March 22, 2052 officially marked the end of privacy, but 
                                        it was still a great help in preventing a lot of crime 
                                        in a world plunged into darkness after dark.
                                        Due to global warming, the skies were unfortunately 
                                        often overcast and rainy, which prevented the drones and 
                                        solar panels from recharging. The solution came this time 
                                        from China, with the sending at regular intervals every 
                                        night of silver iodide missiles in the clouds in order to trigger 
                                        torrential rains.
                                        This also allowed to reduce the crime once again.
                                        And so it was for three years, it is at this time that we can 
                                        note a massive rise in dissent, indeed, the anger of the 
                                        impoverished, persecuted and starving populations in slums, 
                                        or insalubrious house began seriously to rumble.
                                        The 3-year internet blackout had had the effect of stopping 
                                        the continuous consumerist propaganda they were usually fed.
                                        The only representation of the elite they had had for 3 
                                        years was the persecution of drones and the lights of the 
                                        barbed wire villas in the distance on the hills
                                        <br><br>
                                        Meanwhile, the industrialists were working hard on an energy transition 
                                        The simplest solution was nuclear power to continue to supply energy.

                                        The end of the 21st century is characterized by great wars of 
                                        religion and great World War
                                        The feeling of anger of the people was diverted in order to
                                        put the people against each other, divide and conquer. This 
                                        created a huge arms market on a planet that had been 
                                        pacified for years.
                                        But this respite for the elites was short-lived... Indeed, 
                                        a general depletion of deposits and other natural resources
                                        created tensions between companies. Indeed, price inflation, 
                                        economic disagreements as well as a general impoverishment 
                                        of the companies and states put them in direct competition,

                                        In fact, approximately 4.5 billion people died during this

                                        the world's population was cut in half.
                                        Everyone had lost someone close to them.
                                        These unfortunate events had the positive effect of restoring

                                        Less known to the public, this peace was declared 
                                        following the discovery of deposits of rare minerals 
                                        and oil in the Arctic after the ice melted completely.
                                        But there was still dissent among the peoples.
                                        They were tired and bruised by so much violence, the 
                                        companies had indeed put ointment on their wounds by

                                        the control worsened over this period.

                                        This could not last any longer, a real revolution was needed 
                                        and the peoples organized themselves in 2092, indeed the futile 
                                        wars of the proletariat of these last years had both annihilated 
                                        the weakest, as well as put the real issues in their place. This 
                                        allowed a real world union of peoples, aspiring to be free. The 
                                        rebellion was finally organized, and motivated to fight.
                                        Small urban guerrillas broke out all over the world.
                                        Highly organized, surgical strikes on the part of the rebels, 
                                        with increasing strength and means as the general feeling of 
                                        anger of the population grew with them

                                        Then came the second drama of the twenty-first century
                                        In a last desperate effort to overthrow the ruling empires, 
                                        several rebel groups organized Project Chaos: the simultaneous 
                                        destruction of the world's largest nuclear power plants.
                                        The goal was to short-circuit the Internet and monetary networks 
                                        in order to free the indebted and economically enslaved people 
                                        and to simply remove the source of power of the economic elites.
                                        And their actions worked.
                                        Unfortunately to the detriment of humanity.
                                        These simultaneous explosions on every continent of the 
                                        world on a power scale of 40 times Hiroshima had the effect 
                                        of eliminating more than 80% of the world population.

                                        Then came what was called the dark age of humanity.
                                        A large part of the economic elites having been atomized, scientific 
                                        knowledge had with them almost disappeared, effectively the people
                                        were only trained to work like automatons, they were unable to 
                                        understand how the old technologies worked. Plunging then the 
                                        humanity several centuries backwards
                                        At the beginning of the 22nd century, small organized communities of 
                                        techno-barbarians were founded all over the planet among the survivors.
                                        These factions, wild and primitive, fought among themselves for the 
                                        few remaining resources.
                                        The planet being 97% irradiated, the life expectancy of the 
                                        survivors rarely exceeded 30 years.
                                        Humanity was running straight to its doom.

                                        But from the ashes emerged a true jewel of technology. 
                                        A city spared by environmental nuclear disasters.
                                        In the middle of the Sahara, the laboratory city of the 
                                        Cardano Institute had been largely spared.
                                        Its initial population of 800 researchers and workers had 
                                        been reduced to three quarters due to famine and settling 
                                        of accounts between gangs.
                                        After years of civil war and war with barbarian tribes, a 
                                        consensus was reached that the situation was serious.
                                        In spite of the serious radioactive deterioration, the 
                                        researchers put all their intelligence into the search for 
                                        a remedy for humanity.
                                        Unfortunately, the environmental sciences had been neglected 
                                        in recent years, so they did not have enough time and 
                                        resources to find a solution.
                                        Then a researcher made a discovery in the hold of one of 
                                        the ships at the institute's spaceport.
                                        7 pure genetic strains from the golden age of humanity in test tubes.
                                        The scientists then set out to repopulate the world with 
                                        genetically identical clones from these few pure strains.
                                        Indeed, it was easier for them to make these genetically 
                                        modified humans resistant to radiation than to find a 
                                        cure for an already sick humanity.
                                        This is how the E.N.D. Project was created in 2102.

                                        The project was a great success, in a few months the 
                                        scientists were able to create a veritable army of clones 
                                        genetically enhanced to resist radiation and were able 
                                        to send them to the four corners of the world on a "crusade" 
                                        to eliminate the local factions in order to clear the way 
                                        for their brothers and sisters still in production.
                                        The downside was that although they were not sterile, 
                                        their children died instantly. Scientists speculated 
                                        that the genetic strains were not stored properly or 
                                        that the radiation was still too concentrated on the 
                                        earth's surface.
                                        Nevertheless, it was a success.

                                        But the Cardano faction was not the only one to have retained
                                        rudimentary technological knowledge.
                                        Everywhere on earth small bubbles of knowledge and rudimentary
                                        technology had emerged over the years and remained in 
                                        some of the dominant factions.
                                        The humans of the E.N.D. project were captured in these places,
                                        and through a technique that is still poorly understood 
                                        today due to lack of documentation, some local scientists 
                                        were able to retrieve DNA data from the E.N.D.'s in order 
                                        to link them to the local population.
                                        This allowed to extend the life expectancy of the survivors, 
                                        who, even though they were plagued by cancer and other diseases
                                        caused by radiation, were able to produce and gradually, over
                                        the years, dilute their depleted genes. 
                                        A veritable genetic black market was created on Earth which 
                                        allowed the most technologically advanced factions to gain 
                                        enormous power and respect.
                                        As well as to pacify the relations between tribes.
                                        An organization was set up.
                                        Some tribes became hunters, making real raids in the E.N.D. 
                                        communities in order to capture them to sell them.
                                        The richer and more developed factions became the real market
                                        leaders by selling genetic mutations from E.N.D. stem codes.
                                        And further down the hierarchy, clandestine doctors allowed

                                    <p>
                                        Initially unknown to the Cardano Institute, these facts went 
                                        unnoticed for a very long time.
                                        The scientists of the institute had other more urgent problems 
                                        to deal with, their own imminent death.
                                        For this reason, they came up with the idea of uploading 
                                        their consciousness into computers, a crisis solution that 
                                        finally proved to be their salvation.
                                        They then started the production of an army of androids
                                        In the year 2116, they set up a huge expedition, with 16 
                                        groups of 150 androids, each administered by an android 
                                        with human consciousness.
                                        Each group had to go to a specific area of the globe and 
                                        return after a year to report on the situation.
                                        In 2117 only one group returned, the report was disastrous,
                                        human civilization had restarted, hostile and genetically 
                                        modified humans with E.N.D. genomes had repopulated the 
                                        areas most spared from radiation in order to create mega cities.
                                        What was the astonishment of the Cardano Institute.
                                        The fruit of their work soiled...
                                        Their rage was terrible
                                        Their decision was made, they were going to form the biggest 
                                        army ever conceived and to leave to massacre all these 
                                        humans who had profited from their work and polluted 
                                        the genes of their creations.
                                        Some still struggle to understand the reaction of the 
                                        androids of the institute.
                                        It seems that the uploading of their consciousness into the 
                                        machine has destroyed their capacity for empathy.
                                        Indeed, the scientists had to create a central unit with a 
                                        structure similar to the human brain in order to upload 
                                        their consciousness. It seems that they neglected the anterior
                                        cingulate cortex and its connection to the frontal heart, the 
                                        seat of decision making. Thus these androids had lost one of 
                                        the main traits of humanity, while keeping their most famous flaws.
                                        In the year 2122, the army was ready and the Cardano 
                                        Institute could start its crusade, they were going to 
                                        conquer the world and satiate the free peoples, and 
                                        every island of resistance would be destroyed.
